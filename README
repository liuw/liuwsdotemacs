liuw's dotemacs file

This is my personal emacs configurations.

Startup files dedicated to certain topics are to be place in the `init-files` directory, which will be loaded according to their alphabet order.

All local configurations go into init-files/99local-conf.el, which will be loaded as the last conf file.
