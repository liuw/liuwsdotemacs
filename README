liuw's dotemacs file

Author: Wei Liu <liuw@liuw.name>

This is my personal Emacs configurations.

Startup files dedicated to certain topics are to be placed in the `init-files`
directory, which will be loaded according to their alphabetic order.

All local configurations go into init-files/99local-conf.el, which will be
loaded as the last conf file. Please note that init-files/99local-conf.el is
not tracked by Git, so you need to create it yourself when you need it.
